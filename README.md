Miscellaneous tools used in the lab.

## HKang_CoeffOfDetermination.ipf

Calculates the R<sup>2</sup> (coefficient of determination) value between 2 input waves. Ideally, this function can be used between a model output and measurement values.

## HKang_ConvertToNaNperiod.ipf

Takes time and concentration waves and designated times and converts the concentrations within those designated times to NaN.

## HKang_DeleteNaNPoints.ipf

Deletes NaN points in a wave.

## HKang_GetMultipleR2.ipf

Finds the R2 from linear regressions of multiple waves (or matrix) and saves those R2 values into an output wave.
